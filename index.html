        <p>I have always had a curious mind. I always strive to learn how things work from heavy machines, electronics,
            electrical appliances and even such simple things as lighters. I have no prior background in IT, but have
            studied and qualified in CPA (section II), of Arts degree in Gender and Development, and I am a certified
            mixologist with 4 years experience.</p>
        <p>I took up the programming class so that I can learn how to talk to machines. IT is the next big thing in
            Africa,
            and I definitely getting a piece of that cake. Programming amuses me to the core. From the complex stuff
            such as
            robotics and AI, Machine learning to the much simpler stuff like creating and styling web-pages. I just love
            it!!!</p>
