    <p>I have always had a curious mind. I always strive to learn how things work from heavy machines, electronics,
        electrical appliances and even such simple things as lighters. I have no prior background in IT, but have
        studied and qualified in CPA (section II), of Arts degree in Gender and Development, and I am a certified
        mixologist with 4 years experience. </p>
    <p>Why Code?</p>
